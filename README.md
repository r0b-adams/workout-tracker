# Workout Tracker

## Description

This application allows a user to create a new workout or add exercises to an existing workout. The user can view the total duration and total weight of multiple exercises from their past seven workouts on the "stats" page. This project provided the opportunity to create an application using a Mongo database with Mongoose schema. Express.js is used to handle routing.
